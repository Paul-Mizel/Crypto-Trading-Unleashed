hammer_ = 'The hammer candlestick pattern is formed of a short body with a long lower wick, and is found at the bottom of a downward trend.' + '\n' + '\n A hammer shows that although there were selling pressures during the day, ultimately a strong buying pressure drove the price back up.'
ihammer_ = 'The inverted hammer is a similar pattern than the hammer pattern. The only difference being that the upper wick is long, while the lower wick is short.' + '\n' + '\n It indicates a buying pressure, followed by a selling pressure that was not strong enough to drive the market price down. The inverse hammer suggests that buyers will soon have control of the market.'
bulleng_ = 'The bullish engulfing pattern is formed of two candlesticks. The first candle is a short red body that is completely engulfed by a larger green candle' + '\n' + '\n Though the second day opens lower than the first, the bullish market pushes the price up, culminating in an obvious win for buyers'
hanging_ = 'The hanging man is the bearish equivalent of a hammer; it has the same shape but forms at the end of an uptrend.' + '\n' + 'It indicates that there was a significant sell-off during the day, but that buyers were able to push the price up again. The large sell-off is often seen as an indication that the bulls are losing control of the market.'
shotting_ = 'The shooting star is the same shape as the inverted hammer, but is formed in an uptrend: it has a small lower body, and a long upper wick.' + '\n' + 'Usually, the market will gap slightly higher on opening and rally to an intra-day high before closing at a price just above the open â€“ like a star falling to the ground.'
beareng_ = 'A bearish engulfing pattern occurs at the end of an uptrend. The first candle has a small green body that is engulfed by a subsequent long red candle.' + '\n' + 'It signifies a peak or slowdown of price movement, and is a sign of an impending market downturn. The lower the second candle goes, the more significant the trend is likely to be.'
